I currently have a functional Reacting-StrapIgniter which is react-bootstrap with react-native and some really cool additions with kiddiecoders in mind but some stuff to help speedup development for the rest of us. It has more package managers than god but my thought behind it all is that I'll have a functionanl setup that will have everything you don't need so what you don't use can get junked and very little time will need to be spent installing and finetuning. and I plan to make a StrAngled Ci (AngularJS2-Bootstrap Codignighter) of the same nature.",
